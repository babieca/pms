now, palm sunday had dawned crystal clear; but pilar had explained that nobody occupied the boxes and chairs to see the procession of palms in the morning; that, though it was pretty to see, it was not one of the great sights; and, as one must be waiting early outside the cathedral, it was unlikely that anyone from carmona's house would be there.

the original plan concocted with marufa and zalu zako in the forest when making the new idol was that birnier should become witch-doctors chief witch-doctor and zalu zako be anointed king-god, with marufa as the power behind the throne.
there were two alternatives: if the visions had been genuine ghosts, then undoubtedly zalu zako was dead; but if they had been produced through the magic of a white man, then, bakahenzie argued, zalu zako and marufa must be in league with moonspirit, and yabolo opined that zalu zako had been captured by eyes-in-the-hands.

for several advertisements, and could then telegraph our whereabouts at the last minute, whenever the movements of carmona's car gave us our this was the best arrangement we could make in a hurry, and when we had time to reflect, it did not seem to us that, in the circumstances, we could have done better.\nthe thing i did not know was, how long he meant to stay in the capital; but as he must show seville in holy week, and later the car of destiny perhaps other places in the south of spain, to lady vale-avon and monica before their return to madrid for the royal wedding, it was almost certain that he would go on in a couple of days.\nnow, lady monica, it's your turn, said carmona; but monica drew back, i hate seeing torture-things, said she, and blood, even wicked old blood like philip's, which i used to think, when i read about him in history, i'd love to shed.\ni was glad to hear this, because if it would put out our fire, it would put out carmona's; and as he was prudent in matters concerning his car, he would probably have stopped at andujar; thus fate would again bring me near to monica, despite our promise.\nit seemed that we could see the pasture which was vivillo's drawing-room without trespassing upon carmona's land, on which i should have been loth to set my foot, even for pilar; but when, after twenty minutes' walk across meadows, we arrived at the hedge which divided the duke's ganaderia from colonel o'donnel's farm, dick would not be satisfied with a distant inspection of the grazing bulls.\nnow, palm sunday had dawned crystal clear; but pilar had explained that nobody occupied the boxes and chairs to see the procession of palms in the morning; that, though it was pretty to see, it was not one of the great sights; and, as one must be waiting early outside the cathedral, it was unlikely that anyone from carmona's house would be there.", 'created': '26-Dec-2018', 'pages':

explained that nobody occupied the boxes and chairs to see the procession of palms in the morning; that, though it was pretty to see, it was not one of the great sights; and, as one must be waiting
